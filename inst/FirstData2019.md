> Confirmation Code: `CFCday19`

**2. Login to IBM Cloud and apply Promo Code**

After requesting and saving the promo code from above, login to [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bdzi6C), select `Manage` from the top menu bar, then `Account`.  Within the account page select the `Account Settings` option and scroll down to enter your feature code retrieved above.
